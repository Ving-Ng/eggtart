                <h5>About his journey</h5>
                <p>He started his journey to post his practice video a.k.a songs cover on social media since Jan 2th 2020 on instagram.</p> <br>
                <p>He was inspired when he knew he was not going to further his studies on music, but he doesn't want to lose his connection with music - his saviour that had saved him from negative emotions for uncountable times.</p><br>
                <p>Thus, he started posting on instagram weekly, and had persistently practice this habit for 61 weeks, 64 (short) covers was recorded.  It wasn't that difficult but it wasn't that easy too, somehow he was surprised too when he was aware about how long he had been doing this.</p><br>
                <p>He was forced to break this streak since he had to go to university during pandemic, when most facilities was not available and he couldn't acsses to any familiar instruments.</p><br>
                <p>But still, during that period, he will update his instagram story once in a while to keep up with his passion</p><br>
                <p>Currently he's updating his song covers to different social media platform including: Instagram, Facebook, Tik Tok, Dou yin(Tik Tok in China) and also Hua Yin.</p>
